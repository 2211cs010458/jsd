## object 

- collection of the properties and methods

## why use OOP


## parts of OOP
object literal

- constructor function 
- prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)


## 4 pillars

Abstraction

- abstraction refers to the process of showing only essential details or functionality to the user while hiding non-essential implementation details.

Encapsulation

- Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes or instance variables) along with the methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class in OOP.

Inheritence

-  is a core feature of OOP that enables code reuse by referencing the behaviors and data of an existing object or class.
When a class inherits from another class, it shares all the attributes and methods of the referenced class.
The class being inherited is called the parent class, superclass, or base class, while the inherited class is called the subclass or child class1.

Polymorphism

- Polymorphism describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms.
In computer science, it refers to the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.
Each type provides its own independent implementation of this shared interface1.
